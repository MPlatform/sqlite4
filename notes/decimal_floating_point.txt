A common internal format is used to represent all numbers in SQLite4.
This format is able to losslessly represent all integer values from 
the maximum unsigned 64-bit integer down to the smallest (most negative)
signed 64-bit integer.  The format is also able to represent floating
point numbers spanning a greater range and precision than IEEE 754
binary64.

SQLite4 makes no distinction between integer and floating point numbers.
It does, however, distinguish between exact and approximate numbers.  In
C/C++, integers are exact and floating point numbers are approximate.
But this is not necessarily true of SQLite4.  Floating point numbers can
be exact in SQLite4.  Integers that can be represented in 64-bits are 
always exact in SQLite4 but larger integers might be approximate.

The SQLite4 numeric format is for internal use.  Numbers can be translated
between integers or doubles for input and output.  The on-disk storage
space required for SQLite4 numbers varies from between 1 and 10 bytes, 
depending on the magnitude and the number of significant digits in the
value.

The SQLite4 numeric format is a decimal floating point format.  
The significant is a 18-digit decimal number, represented internally as
an unsigned 64-bit integer.  A base-10 exponent with 3-digits of precision
is used, represented internally as an unsigned 11-bit integer.  Both the
significant and the exponent can be signed, of course.  This gives a
maximum value of:

  999,999,999,999,999,999 e 999

Infinities are represented by any non-zero number with an exponent of
1000 or more.  A zero significant with an exponent of 1000 or more
is a NaN.

The IEEE 754 decimal representation was considered as the format for SQLite4
but was rejected as having insufficient precision and being overly complex.

Because a base-10 exponent is used, there are no round-off error problems
when converting the fractional part between decimal and the internal 
representation.  Furthermore, this format can exactly represent any 
signed 64-bit integer, which IEEE 754 binary64 cannot do.  Any decimal
floating point number with an 3-digit exponent and 18 or fewer significant
digits can be represented exactly in this representation.

An SQLite4 number can always be stored in 10 bytes.  However, for
significants with fewer than 18 significant digits and/or exponents with
fewer than 3 significant digits, one can devise alternative representation
that use less space.  Current plans are to support 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-,
8-, and 10-byte on-disk representations.

as decimal.
