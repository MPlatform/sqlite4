** This interface only reports on the compile-time mutex setting

** without having to use a lot of C code. 
**
** ^The sqlite4_exec() interface runs zero or more UTF-8 encoded,

** in the context of the [database connection] passed in as its 1st
** argument.  ^If the callback function of the 3rd argument to
** sqlite4_exec() is not NULL, then it is invoked for each result row
** coming out of the evaluated SQL statements.  ^The 4th argument to
** sqlite4_exec() is relayed through to the 1st argument of each
** callback invocation.  ^If the callback pointer to sqlite4_exec()
** is NULL, then no callback is ever invoked and result rows are
** ignored.
**
** ^If an error occurs while evaluating the SQL statements passed into
** sqlite4_exec(), then execution of the current statement stops and
** subsequent statements are skipped.  ^If the 5th parameter to sqlite4_exec()
** is not NULL then any error message is written into memory obtained
** from [sqlite4_malloc()] and passed back through the 5th parameter.
** To avoid memory leaks, the application should invoke [sqlite4_free()]
** on error message strings returned through the 5th parameter of
** of sqlite4_exec() after the error message string is no longer needed.
** ^If the 5th parameter to sqlite4_exec() is not NULL and no errors
** occur, then sqlite4_exec() sets the pointer in its 5th parameter to
** NULL before returning.
**
** ^If an sqlite4_exec() callback returns non-zero, the sqlite4_exec()
** routine returns SQLITE_ABORT without invoking the callback again and
** without running any subsequent SQL statements.
**
** ^The 2nd argument to the sqlite4_exec() callback function is the
** number of columns in the result.  ^The 3rd argument to the sqlite4_exec()
** callback is an array of pointers to strings obtained as if from
** [sqlite4_column_text()], one for each column.  ^If an element of a
** result row is NULL then the corresponding string pointer for the
** sqlite4_exec() callback is a NULL pointer.  ^The 4th argument to the
** sqlite4_exec() callback is an array of pointers to strings where each
** entry represents the name of corresponding result column as obtained
** from [sqlite4_column_name()].
**
** ^If the 2nd parameter to sqlite4_exec() is a NULL pointer, a pointer
** to an empty string, or a pointer that contains only whitespace and/or 
** SQL comments, then no SQL statements are evaluated and the database
** is not changed.

**
** The sqlite4_config() interface is not threadsafe.  The application
** must insure that no other SQLite interfaces are used with the same

** CAPIREF: Memory Allocation Routines
**
** An instance of this object defines the interface between SQLite
** and low-level memory allocation routines.
**
** This object is used in only one place in the SQLite interface.
** A pointer to an instance of this object is the argument to
** [sqlite4_config()] when the configuration option is
** [SQLITE_CONFIG_MALLOC] or [SQLITE_CONFIG_GETMALLOC].  
** By creating an instance of this object
** and passing it to [sqlite4_config]([SQLITE_CONFIG_MALLOC])
** during configuration, an application can specify an alternative
** memory allocation subsystem for SQLite to use for all of its
** dynamic memory needs.
**
** Note that SQLite comes with several [built-in memory allocators]
** that are perfectly adequate for the overwhelming majority of applications
** and that this object is only useful to a tiny minority of applications
** with specialized memory allocation requirements.  This object is
** also used during testing of SQLite in order to specify an alternative
** memory allocator that simulates memory out-of-memory conditions in
** order to verify that SQLite recovers gracefully from such
** conditions.
**
** The xMalloc, xRealloc, and xFree methods must work like the
** malloc(), realloc() and free() functions from the standard C library.
** ^SQLite guarantees that the second argument to
** xRealloc is always a value returned by a prior call to xRoundup.
**
** xSize should return the allocated size of a memory allocation
** previously obtained from xMalloc or xRealloc.  The allocated size
** is always at least as big as the requested size but may be larger.
**
** The xRoundup method returns what would be the allocated size of
** a memory allocation given a particular requested size.  Most memory
** allocators round up memory allocations at least to the next multiple
** of 8.  Some allocators round up to a larger multiple or to a power of 2.
** Every memory allocation request coming in through [sqlite4_malloc()]
** or [sqlite4_realloc()] first calls xRoundup.  If xRoundup returns 0, 
** that causes the corresponding memory allocation to fail.
**
** The xInit method initializes the memory allocator.  (For example,
** it might allocate any require mutexes or initialize internal data
** structures.  The xShutdown method is invoked (indirectly) by
** [sqlite4_shutdown()] and should deallocate any resources acquired
** by xInit.  The pAppData pointer is used as the only parameter to
** xInit and xShutdown.
**
** SQLite holds the [SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MASTER] mutex when it invokes
** the xInit method, so the xInit method need not be threadsafe.  The
** xShutdown method is only called from [sqlite4_shutdown()] so it does
** not need to be threadsafe either.  For all other methods, SQLite
** holds the [SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM] mutex as long as the
** [SQLITE_CONFIG_MEMSTATUS] configuration option is turned on (which
** it is by default) and so the methods are automatically serialized.
** However, if [SQLITE_CONFIG_MEMSTATUS] is disabled, then the other
** methods must be threadsafe or else make their own arrangements for
** serialization.
**
** SQLite will never invoke xInit() more than once without an intervening
** call to xShutdown().

** CAPIREF: Formatted String Printing Functions
**
** These routines are work-alikes of the "printf()" family of functions
** from the standard C library.
**
** ^The sqlite4_mprintf() and sqlite4_vmprintf() routines write their
** results into memory obtained from [sqlite4_malloc()].
** The strings returned by these two routines should be
** released by [sqlite4_free()].  ^Both routines return a
** NULL pointer if [sqlite4_malloc()] is unable to allocate enough
** memory to hold the resulting string.
**
** ^(The sqlite4_snprintf() routine is similar to "snprintf()" from
** the standard C library.  The result is written into the
** buffer supplied as the second parameter whose size is given by
** the first parameter. Note that the order of the
** first two parameters is reversed from snprintf().)^  This is an
** historical accident that cannot be fixed without breaking
** backwards compatibility.  ^(Note also that sqlite4_snprintf()
** returns a pointer to its buffer instead of the number of
** characters actually written into the buffer.)^  We admit that
** the number of characters written would be a more useful return
** value but we cannot change the implementation of sqlite4_snprintf()
** now without breaking compatibility.
**
** ^As long as the buffer size is greater than zero, sqlite4_snprintf()
** guarantees that the buffer is always zero-terminated.  ^The first
** parameter "n" is the total size of the buffer, including space for
** the zero terminator.  So the longest string that can be completely
** written will be n-1 characters.
**
** ^The sqlite4_vsnprintf() routine is a varargs version of sqlite4_snprintf().
**
** These routines all implement some additional formatting
** options that are useful for constructing SQL statements.
** All of the usual printf() formatting options apply.  In addition, there
** is are "%q", "%Q", and "%z" options.
**
** ^(The %q option works like %s in that it substitutes a nul-terminated
** string from the argument list.  But %q also doubles every '\'' character.
** %q is designed for use inside a string literal.)^  By doubling each '\''
** character it escapes that character and allows it to be inserted into
** the string.
**
** For example, assume the string variable zText contains text as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zText = "It's a happy day!";
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** One can use this text in an SQL statement as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zSQL = sqlite4_mprintf("INSERT INTO table VALUES('%q')", zText);
**  sqlite4_exec(db, zSQL, 0, 0, 0);
**  sqlite4_free(zSQL);
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** Because the %q format string is used, the '\'' character in zText
** is escaped and the SQL generated is as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It''s a happy day!')
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** This is correct.  Had we used %s instead of %q, the generated SQL
** would have looked like this:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It's a happy day!');
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** This second example is an SQL syntax error.  As a general rule you should
** always use %q instead of %s when inserting text into a string literal.
**
** ^(The %Q option works like %q except it also adds single quotes around
** the outside of the total string.  Additionally, if the parameter in the
** argument list is a NULL pointer, %Q substitutes the text "NULL" (without
** single quotes).)^  So, for example, one could say:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zSQL = sqlite4_mprintf("INSERT INTO table VALUES(%Q)", zText);
**  sqlite4_exec(db, zSQL, 0, 0, 0);
**  sqlite4_free(zSQL);
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** The code above will render a correct SQL statement in the zSQL
** variable even if the zText variable is a NULL pointer.
**
** ^(The "%z" formatting option works like "%s" but with the
** addition that after the string has been read and copied into
** the result, [sqlite4_free()] is called on the input string.)^

** ^If sqlite4_malloc() is unable to obtain sufficient free

** sqlite4_malloc() is zero or negative then sqlite4_malloc() returns
** a NULL pointer.
**
** ^Calling sqlite4_free() with a pointer previously returned
** by sqlite4_malloc() or sqlite4_realloc() releases that memory so
** that it might be reused.  ^The sqlite4_free() routine is
** a no-op if is called with a NULL pointer.  Passing a NULL pointer
** to sqlite4_free() is harmless.  After being freed, memory
** should neither be read nor written.  Even reading previously freed
** memory might result in a segmentation fault or other severe error.
** Memory corruption, a segmentation fault, or other severe error
** might result if sqlite4_free() is called with a non-NULL pointer that
** was not obtained from sqlite4_malloc() or sqlite4_realloc().
**
** ^(The sqlite4_realloc() interface attempts to resize a
** prior memory allocation to be at least N bytes, where N is the
** second parameter.  The memory allocation to be resized is the first
** parameter.)^ ^ If the first parameter to sqlite4_realloc()
** is a NULL pointer then its behavior is identical to calling
** sqlite4_malloc(N) where N is the second parameter to sqlite4_realloc().
** ^If the second parameter to sqlite4_realloc() is zero or
** negative then the behavior is exactly the same as calling
** sqlite4_free(P) where P is the first parameter to sqlite4_realloc().
** ^sqlite4_realloc() returns a pointer to a memory allocation
** of at least N bytes in size or NULL if sufficient memory is unavailable.
** ^If M is the size of the prior allocation, then min(N,M) bytes
** of the prior allocation are copied into the beginning of buffer returned
** by sqlite4_realloc() and the prior allocation is freed.
** ^If sqlite4_realloc() returns NULL, then the prior allocation
** is not freed.
**
** ^The memory returned by sqlite4_malloc() and sqlite4_realloc()
** is always aligned to at least an 8 byte boundary, or to a

** [sqlite4_prepare16()] and [sqlite4_prepare16_v2()].  ^At various
** points during the compilation process, as logic is being created
** to perform various actions, the authorizer callback is invoked to
** see if those actions are allowed.  ^The authorizer callback should
** return [SQLITE_OK] to allow the action, [SQLITE_IGNORE] to disallow the
** specific action but allow the SQL statement to continue to be
** compiled, or [SQLITE_DENY] to cause the entire SQL statement to be
** rejected with an error.  ^If the authorizer callback returns
** any value other than [SQLITE_IGNORE], [SQLITE_OK], or [SQLITE_DENY]
** then the [sqlite4_prepare_v2()] or equivalent call that triggered
** the authorizer will fail with an error message.
**
** When the callback returns [SQLITE_OK], that means the operation
** requested is ok.  ^When the callback returns [SQLITE_DENY], the
** [sqlite4_prepare_v2()] or equivalent call that triggered the
** authorizer will fail with an error message explaining that
** access is denied. 
**
** ^The first parameter to the authorizer callback is a copy of the third
** parameter to the sqlite4_set_authorizer() interface. ^The second parameter
** to the callback is an integer [SQLITE_COPY | action code] that specifies
** the particular action to be authorized. ^The third through sixth parameters
** to the callback are zero-terminated strings that contain additional
** details about the action to be authorized.
**
** ^If the action code is [SQLITE_READ]
** and the callback returns [SQLITE_IGNORE] then the
** [prepared statement] statement is constructed to substitute
** a NULL value in place of the table column that would have
** been read if [SQLITE_OK] had been returned.  The [SQLITE_IGNORE]
** return can be used to deny an untrusted user access to individual
** columns of a table.
** ^If the action code is [SQLITE_DELETE] and the callback returns
** [SQLITE_IGNORE] then the [DELETE] operation proceeds but the
** [truncate optimization] is disabled and all rows are deleted individually.
**
** An authorizer is used when [sqlite4_prepare | preparing]
** SQL statements from an untrusted source, to ensure that the SQL statements
** do not try to access data they are not allowed to see, or that they do not
** try to execute malicious statements that damage the database.  For
** example, an application may allow a user to enter arbitrary
** SQL queries for evaluation by a database.  But the application does
** not want the user to be able to make arbitrary changes to the
** database.  An authorizer could then be put in place while the
** user-entered SQL is being [sqlite4_prepare | prepared] that
** disallows everything except [SELECT] statements.
**
** Applications that need to process SQL from untrusted sources
** might also consider lowering resource limits using [sqlite4_limit()]
** and limiting database size using the [max_page_count] [PRAGMA]
** in addition to using an authorizer.
**
** ^(Only a single authorizer can be in place on a database connection
** at a time.  Each call to sqlite4_set_authorizer overrides the
** previous call.)^  ^Disable the authorizer by installing a NULL callback.
** The authorizer is disabled by default.

** the database connection that invoked the authorizer callback.

**
** ^When [sqlite4_prepare_v2()] is used to prepare a statement, the
** statement might be re-prepared during [sqlite4_step()] due to a 
** schema change.  Hence, the application should ensure that the
** correct authorizer callback remains in place during the [sqlite4_step()].
**
** ^Note that the authorizer callback is invoked only during
** [sqlite4_prepare()] or its variants.  Authorization is not

** The first argument, "db", is a [database connection] obtained from a
** prior successful call to [sqlite4_open()].
** The database connection must not have been closed.
**
** The second argument, "zSql", is the statement to be compiled, encoded
** as either UTF-8 or UTF-16.  The sqlite4_prepare() and sqlite4_prepare_v2()
** interfaces use UTF-8, and sqlite4_prepare16() and sqlite4_prepare16_v2()
** use UTF-16.
**
** ^If the nByte argument is less than zero, then zSql is read up to the
** first zero terminator. ^If nByte is non-negative, then it is the maximum
** number of  bytes read from zSql.  ^When nByte is non-negative, the
** zSql string ends at either the first '\000' or '\u0000' character or
** the nByte-th byte, whichever comes first. If the caller knows
** that the supplied string is nul-terminated, then there is a small
** performance advantage to be gained by passing an nByte parameter that
** is equal to the number of bytes in the input string <i>including</i>
** the nul-terminator bytes as this saves SQLite from having to
** make a copy of the input string.
**
** ^If pzTail is not NULL then *pzTail is made to point to the first byte
** past the end of the first SQL statement in zSql.  These routines only
** compile the first statement in zSql, so *pzTail is left pointing to

** to NULL.  ^If the input text contains no SQL (if the input is an empty

**
** ^The first argument to the sqlite4_bind_*() routines is always

**
** ^The second argument is the index of the SQL parameter to be set.
** ^The leftmost SQL parameter has an index of 1.  ^When the same named

** occurrences have the same index as the first occurrence.
** ^The index for named parameters can be looked up using the
** [sqlite4_bind_parameter_index()] API if desired.  ^The index
** for "?NNN" parameters is the value of NNN.
** ^The NNN value must be between 1 and the [sqlite4_limit()]
** parameter [SQLITE_LIMIT_VARIABLE_NUMBER] (default value: 999).
**
** ^The third argument is the value to bind to the parameter.
**
** ^(In those routines that have a fourth argument, its value is the
** number of bytes in the parameter.  To be clear: the value is the
** number of <u>bytes</u> in the value, not the number of characters.)^
** ^If the fourth parameter is negative, the length of the string is
** the number of bytes up to the first zero terminator.
** If a non-negative fourth parameter is provided to sqlite4_bind_text()
** or sqlite4_bind_text16() then that parameter must be the byte offset
** where the NUL terminator would occur assuming the string were NUL

** the value of the fourth parameter then the resulting string value will
** contain embedded NULs.  The result of expressions involving strings
** with embedded NULs is undefined.
**
** ^The fifth argument to sqlite4_bind_blob(), sqlite4_bind_text(), and

** ^If the fifth argument is
** the special value [SQLITE_STATIC], then SQLite assumes that the
** information is in static, unmanaged space and does not need to be freed.
** ^If the fifth argument has the value [SQLITE_TRANSIENT], then
** SQLite makes its own private copy of the data immediately, before
** the sqlite4_bind_*() routine returns.
**
** ^The sqlite4_bind_zeroblob() routine binds a BLOB of length N that
** is filled with zeroes.  ^A zeroblob uses a fixed amount of memory
** (just an integer to hold its size) while it is being processed.
** Zeroblobs are intended to serve as placeholders for BLOBs whose

** ^A negative value for the zeroblob results in a zero-length BLOB.
**
** ^If any of the sqlite4_bind_*() routines are called with a NULL pointer

**
** After a [prepared statement] has been prepared using either
** [sqlite4_prepare_v2()] or [sqlite4_prepare16_v2()] or one of the legacy
** interfaces [sqlite4_prepare()] or [sqlite4_prepare16()], this function
** must be called one or more times to evaluate the statement.
**
** The details of the behavior of the sqlite4_step() interface depend
** on whether the statement was prepared using the newer "v2" interface
** [sqlite4_prepare_v2()] and [sqlite4_prepare16_v2()] or the older legacy
** interface [sqlite4_prepare()] and [sqlite4_prepare16()].  The use of the
** new "v2" interface is recommended for new applications but the legacy
** interface will continue to be supported.
**
** ^In the legacy interface, the return value will be either [SQLITE_BUSY],
** [SQLITE_DONE], [SQLITE_ROW], [SQLITE_ERROR], or [SQLITE_MISUSE].
** ^With the "v2" interface, any of the other [result codes] or
** [extended result codes] might be returned as well.
**
** ^[SQLITE_BUSY] means that the database engine was unable to acquire the
** database locks it needs to do its job.  ^If the statement is a [COMMIT]
** or occurs outside of an explicit transaction, then you can retry the
** statement.  If the statement is not a [COMMIT] and occurs within an
** explicit transaction then you should rollback the transaction before
** continuing.
**
** ^[SQLITE_DONE] means that the statement has finished executing
** successfully.  sqlite4_step() should not be called again on this virtual
** machine without first calling [sqlite4_reset()] to reset the virtual
** machine back to its initial state.
**
** ^If the SQL statement being executed returns any data, then [SQLITE_ROW]
** is returned each time a new row of data is ready for processing by the
** caller. The values may be accessed using the [column access functions].
** sqlite4_step() is called again to retrieve the next row of data.
**
** ^[SQLITE_ERROR] means that a run-time error (such as a constraint
** violation) has occurred.  sqlite4_step() should not be called again on
** the VM. More information may be found by calling [sqlite4_errmsg()].
** ^With the legacy interface, a more specific error code (for example,
** [SQLITE_INTERRUPT], [SQLITE_SCHEMA], [SQLITE_CORRUPT], and so forth)
** can be obtained by calling [sqlite4_reset()] on the
** [prepared statement].  ^In the "v2" interface,
** the more specific error code is returned directly by sqlite4_step().
**
** [SQLITE_MISUSE] means that the this routine was called inappropriately.
** Perhaps it was called on a [prepared statement] that has
** already been [sqlite4_finalize | finalized] or on one that had
** previously returned [SQLITE_ERROR] or [SQLITE_DONE].  Or it could
** be the case that the same database connection is being used by two or
** more threads at the same moment in time.
**
** For all versions of SQLite up to and including 3.6.23.1, a call to
** [sqlite4_reset()] was required after sqlite4_step() returned anything
** other than [SQLITE_ROW] before any subsequent invocation of
** sqlite4_step().  Failure to reset the prepared statement using 
** [sqlite4_reset()] would result in an [SQLITE_MISUSE] return from
** sqlite4_step().  But after version 3.6.23.1, sqlite4_step() began
** calling [sqlite4_reset()] automatically in this circumstance rather
** than returning [SQLITE_MISUSE].  This is not considered a compatibility
** break because any application that ever receives an SQLITE_MISUSE error
** is broken by definition.  The [SQLITE_OMIT_AUTORESET] compile-time option
** can be used to restore the legacy behavior.
**
** <b>Goofy Interface Alert:</b> In the legacy interface, the sqlite4_step()
** API always returns a generic error code, [SQLITE_ERROR], following any
** error other than [SQLITE_BUSY] and [SQLITE_MISUSE].  You must call
** [sqlite4_reset()] or [sqlite4_finalize()] in order to find one of the
** specific [error codes] that better describes the error.
** We admit that this is a goofy design.  The problem has been fixed
** with the "v2" interface.  If you prepare all of your SQL statements
** using either [sqlite4_prepare_v2()] or [sqlite4_prepare16_v2()] instead
** of the legacy [sqlite4_prepare()] and [sqlite4_prepare16()] interfaces,
** then the more specific [error codes] are returned directly
** by sqlite4_step().  The use of the "v2" interface is recommended.

** If any of these routines are called after [sqlite4_reset()] or

** something other than [SQLITE_ROW], the results are undefined.
** If [sqlite4_step()] or [sqlite4_reset()] or [sqlite4_finalize()]

** are pending, then the results are undefined.
**
** ^The sqlite4_column_type() routine returns the

** versions of SQLite may change the behavior of sqlite4_column_type()
** following a type conversion.
**
** ^If the result is a BLOB or UTF-8 string then the sqlite4_column_bytes()

** ^If the result is NULL, then sqlite4_column_bytes() returns zero.
**
** ^If the result is a BLOB or UTF-16 string then the sqlite4_column_bytes16()

** ^If the result is a UTF-8 string, then sqlite4_column_bytes16() converts

**
** The table above makes reference to standard C library functions atoi()
** and atof().  SQLite does not really use these functions.  It has its
** own equivalent internal routines.  The atoi() and atof() names are
** used in the table for brevity and because they are familiar to most
** C programmers.
**
** Note that when type conversions occur, pointers returned by prior
** calls to sqlite4_column_blob(), sqlite4_column_text(), and/or
** sqlite4_column_text16() may be invalidated.
** Type conversions and pointer invalidations might occur
** in the following cases:
**
** <ul>
** <li> The initial content is a BLOB and sqlite4_column_text() or
**      sqlite4_column_text16() is called.  A zero-terminator might
**      need to be added to the string.</li>
** <li> The initial content is UTF-8 text and sqlite4_column_bytes16() or
**      sqlite4_column_text16() is called.  The content must be converted
**      to UTF-16.</li>
** <li> The initial content is UTF-16 text and sqlite4_column_bytes() or
**      sqlite4_column_text() is called.  The content must be converted
**      to UTF-8.</li>
** </ul>
**
** ^Conversions between UTF-16be and UTF-16le are always done in place and do
** not invalidate a prior pointer, though of course the content of the buffer
** that the prior pointer references will have been modified.  Other kinds
** of conversion are done in place when it is possible, but sometimes they
** are not possible and in those cases prior pointers are invalidated.
**
** The safest and easiest to remember policy is to invoke these routines
** in one of the following ways:
**
** <ul>
**  <li>sqlite4_column_text() followed by sqlite4_column_bytes()</li>
**  <li>sqlite4_column_blob() followed by sqlite4_column_bytes()</li>
**  <li>sqlite4_column_text16() followed by sqlite4_column_bytes16()</li>
** </ul>
**
** In other words, you should call sqlite4_column_text(),
** sqlite4_column_blob(), or sqlite4_column_text16() first to force the result
** into the desired format, then invoke sqlite4_column_bytes() or
** sqlite4_column_bytes16() to find the size of the result.  Do not mix calls
** to sqlite4_column_text() or sqlite4_column_blob() with calls to
** sqlite4_column_bytes16(), and do not mix calls to sqlite4_column_text16()
** with calls to sqlite4_column_bytes().
**
** ^The pointers returned are valid until a type conversion occurs as
** described above, or until [sqlite4_step()] or [sqlite4_reset()] or
** [sqlite4_finalize()] is called.  ^The memory space used to hold strings
** and BLOBs is freed automatically.  Do <b>not</b> pass the pointers returned
** [sqlite4_column_blob()], [sqlite4_column_text()], etc. into
** [sqlite4_free()].
**
** ^(If a memory allocation error occurs during the evaluation of any
** of these routines, a default value is returned.  The default value
** is either the integer 0, the floating point number 0.0, or a NULL
** pointer.  Subsequent calls to [sqlite4_errcode()] will return
** [SQLITE_NOMEM].)^

** parameter is less than -1 or greater than 127 then the behavior is
** undefined.

** its parameters.  Every SQL function implementation must be able to work
** with UTF-8, UTF-16le, or UTF-16be.  But some implementations may be

** parameters. ^An aggregate SQL function requires an implementation of xStep
** and xFinal and NULL pointer must be passed for xFunc. ^To delete an existing
** SQL function or aggregate, pass NULL pointers for all three function
** callbacks.
**
** ^(If the ninth parameter to sqlite4_create_function_v2() is not NULL,

**
** ^It is permitted to register multiple implementations of the same
** functions with the same name but with either differing numbers of
** arguments or differing preferred text encodings.  ^SQLite will use

**
** ^The sqlite4_result_zeroblob() interfaces set the result of

**
** ^The sqlite4_result_double() interface sets the result from
** an application-defined function to be a floating point value specified
** by its 2nd argument.
**
** ^The sqlite4_result_error() and sqlite4_result_error16() functions
** cause the implemented SQL function to throw an exception.
** ^SQLite uses the string pointed to by the
** 2nd parameter of sqlite4_result_error() or sqlite4_result_error16()
** as the text of an error message.  ^SQLite interprets the error
** message string from sqlite4_result_error() as UTF-8. ^SQLite
** interprets the string from sqlite4_result_error16() as UTF-16 in native
** byte order.  ^If the third parameter to sqlite4_result_error()
** or sqlite4_result_error16() is negative then SQLite takes as the error

** ^If the third parameter to sqlite4_result_error() or

** set the return value of the application-defined function to be
** a text string which is represented as UTF-8, UTF-16 native byte order,
** UTF-16 little endian, or UTF-16 big endian, respectively.
** ^SQLite takes the text result from the application from
** the 2nd parameter of the sqlite4_result_text* interfaces.
** ^If the 3rd parameter to the sqlite4_result_text* interfaces
** is negative, then SQLite takes result text from the 2nd parameter

** in the string at a byte offset that is less than the value of the 3rd
** parameter, then the resulting string will contain embedded NULs and the
** result of expressions operating on strings with embedded NULs is undefined.
** ^If the 4th parameter to the sqlite4_result_text* interfaces
** or sqlite4_result_blob is a non-NULL pointer, then SQLite calls that
** function as the destructor on the text or BLOB result when it has
** finished using that result.
** ^If the 4th parameter to the sqlite4_result_text* interfaces or to

** ^The [SQLITE_UTF16_ALIGNED] value for eTextRep forces strings to begin
** on an even byte address.
**
** ^The fourth argument, pArg, is an application data pointer that is passed
** through as the first argument to the collating function callback.
**
** ^The fifth argument, xCallback, is a pointer to the comparision function.
** ^The sixth argument, xMakeKey, is a pointer to a function that generates
** a sort key.
** ^Multiple functions can be registered using the same name but

** function requires the least amount of data transformation.
** ^If the xCallback argument is NULL then the collating function is
** deleted.  ^When all collating functions having the same name are deleted,
** that collation is no longer usable.
**
** ^The collating function callback is invoked with a copy of the pArg

** <li>   SQLITE_MUTEX_PTHREADS

** and SQLITE_MUTEX_W32 implementations
** are appropriate for use on Unix and Windows.
**
** ^(If SQLite is compiled with the SQLITE_MUTEX_APPDEF preprocessor
** macro defined (with "-DSQLITE_MUTEX_APPDEF=1"), then no mutex
** implementation is included with the library. In this case the
** application must supply a custom mutex implementation using the
** [SQLITE_CONFIG_MUTEX] option of the sqlite4_config() function
** before calling sqlite4_initialize() or any other public sqlite4_
** function that calls sqlite4_initialize().)^
**
** ^The sqlite4_mutex_alloc() routine allocates a new
** mutex and returns a pointer to it. ^If it returns NULL
** that means that a mutex could not be allocated.  ^SQLite
** will unwind its stack and return an error.  ^(The argument
** to sqlite4_mutex_alloc() is one of these integer constants:
**
** <ul>
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MASTER
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM

** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_PRNG
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_LRU
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_LRU2
** </ul>)^
**
** ^The first two constants (SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST and SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE)
** cause sqlite4_mutex_alloc() to create
** a new mutex.  ^The new mutex is recursive when SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
** is used but not necessarily so when SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST is used.
** The mutex implementation does not need to make a distinction
** between SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE and SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST if it does
** not want to.  ^SQLite will only request a recursive mutex in
** cases where it really needs one.  ^If a faster non-recursive mutex
** implementation is available on the host platform, the mutex subsystem
** might return such a mutex in response to SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST.
**
** ^The other allowed parameters to sqlite4_mutex_alloc() (anything other
** than SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST and SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE) each return
** a pointer to a static preexisting mutex.  ^Six static mutexes are
** used by the current version of SQLite.  Future versions of SQLite
** may add additional static mutexes.  Static mutexes are for internal
** use by SQLite only.  Applications that use SQLite mutexes should
** use only the dynamic mutexes returned by SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST or
** SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE.
**
** ^Note that if one of the dynamic mutex parameters (SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST
** or SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE) is used then sqlite4_mutex_alloc()
** returns a different mutex on every call.  ^But for the static
** mutex types, the same mutex is returned on every call that has
** the same type number.
**
** ^The sqlite4_mutex_free() routine deallocates a previously
** allocated dynamic mutex.  ^SQLite is careful to deallocate every
** dynamic mutex that it allocates.  The dynamic mutexes must not be in
** use when they are deallocated.  Attempting to deallocate a static
** mutex results in undefined behavior.  ^SQLite never deallocates
** a static mutex.
**
** ^The sqlite4_mutex_enter() and sqlite4_mutex_try() routines attempt
** to enter a mutex.  ^If another thread is already within the mutex,
** sqlite4_mutex_enter() will block and sqlite4_mutex_try() will return
** SQLITE_BUSY.  ^The sqlite4_mutex_try() interface returns [SQLITE_OK]
** upon successful entry.  ^(Mutexes created using
** SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE can be entered multiple times by the same thread.
** In such cases the,
** mutex must be exited an equal number of times before another thread
** can enter.)^  ^(If the same thread tries to enter any other
** kind of mutex more than once, the behavior is undefined.
** SQLite will never exhibit
** such behavior in its own use of mutexes.)^

** sufficient, however the user has the option of substituting a custom
** implementation for specialized deployments or systems for which SQLite
** does not provide a suitable implementation. In this case, the user
** creates and populates an instance of this structure to pass
** to sqlite4_config() along with the [SQLITE_CONFIG_MUTEX] option.
** Additionally, an instance of this structure can be used as an
** output variable when querying the system for the current mutex
** implementation, using the [SQLITE_CONFIG_GETMUTEX] option.
**
** ^The xMutexInit method defined by this structure is invoked as
** part of system initialization by the sqlite4_initialize() function.
** ^The xMutexInit routine is called by SQLite exactly once for each
** effective call to [sqlite4_initialize()].
**
** ^The xMutexEnd method defined by this structure is invoked as
** part of system shutdown by the sqlite4_shutdown() function. The
** implementation of this method is expected to release all outstanding
** resources obtained by the mutex methods implementation, especially
** those obtained by the xMutexInit method.  ^The xMutexEnd()
** interface is invoked exactly once for each call to [sqlite4_shutdown()].
**
** ^(The remaining seven methods defined by this structure (xMutexAlloc,
** xMutexFree, xMutexEnter, xMutexTry, xMutexLeave, xMutexHeld and
** xMutexNotheld) implement the following interfaces (respectively):
**
** <ul>
**   <li>  [sqlite4_mutex_alloc()] </li>

**
** The only difference is that the public sqlite4_XXX functions enumerated
** above silently ignore any invocations that pass a NULL pointer instead
** of a valid mutex handle. The implementations of the methods defined
** by this structure are not required to handle this case, the results
** of passing a NULL pointer instead of a valid mutex handle are undefined
** (i.e. it is acceptable to provide an implementation that segfaults if

**
** The xMutexInit() method must be threadsafe.  ^It must be harmless to

**
** ^SQLite will invoke the xMutexEnd() method when [sqlite4_shutdown()] is

** CAPIREF: Unlock Notification
**
** ^When running in shared-cache mode, a database operation may fail with
** an [SQLITE_LOCKED] error if the required locks on the shared-cache or
** individual tables within the shared-cache cannot be obtained. See
** [SQLite Shared-Cache Mode] for a description of shared-cache locking. 
** ^This API may be used to register a callback that SQLite will invoke 
** when the connection currently holding the required lock relinquishes it.
** ^This API is only available if the library was compiled with the
** [SQLITE_ENABLE_UNLOCK_NOTIFY] C-preprocessor symbol defined.
**
** See Also: [Using the SQLite Unlock Notification Feature].
**
** ^Shared-cache locks are released when a database connection concludes
** its current transaction, either by committing it or rolling it back. 
**
** ^When a connection (known as the blocked connection) fails to obtain a
** shared-cache lock and SQLITE_LOCKED is returned to the caller, the
** identity of the database connection (the blocking connection) that
** has locked the required resource is stored internally. ^After an 
** application receives an SQLITE_LOCKED error, it may call the
** sqlite4_unlock_notify() method with the blocked connection handle as 
** the first argument to register for a callback that will be invoked
** when the blocking connections current transaction is concluded. ^The
** callback is invoked from within the [sqlite4_step] or [sqlite4_close]
** call that concludes the blocking connections transaction.
**
** ^(If sqlite4_unlock_notify() is called in a multi-threaded application,
** there is a chance that the blocking connection will have already
** concluded its transaction by the time sqlite4_unlock_notify() is invoked.
** If this happens, then the specified callback is invoked immediately,
** from within the call to sqlite4_unlock_notify().)^
**
** ^If the blocked connection is attempting to obtain a write-lock on a
** shared-cache table, and more than one other connection currently holds
** a read-lock on the same table, then SQLite arbitrarily selects one of 
** the other connections to use as the blocking connection.
**
** ^(There may be at most one unlock-notify callback registered by a 
** blocked connection. If sqlite4_unlock_notify() is called when the
** blocked connection already has a registered unlock-notify callback,
** then the new callback replaces the old.)^ ^If sqlite4_unlock_notify() is
** called with a NULL pointer as its second argument, then any existing
** unlock-notify callback is canceled. ^The blocked connections 
** unlock-notify callback may also be canceled by closing the blocked
** connection using [sqlite4_close()].
**
** The unlock-notify callback is not reentrant. If an application invokes
** any sqlite4_xxx API functions from within an unlock-notify callback, a
** crash or deadlock may be the result.
**
** ^Unless deadlock is detected (see below), sqlite4_unlock_notify() always
** returns SQLITE_OK.
**
** <b>Callback Invocation Details</b>
**
** When an unlock-notify callback is registered, the application provides a 
** single void* pointer that is passed to the callback when it is invoked.
** However, the signature of the callback function allows SQLite to pass
** it an array of void* context pointers. The first argument passed to
** an unlock-notify callback is a pointer to an array of void* pointers,
** and the second is the number of entries in the array.
**
** When a blocking connections transaction is concluded, there may be
** more than one blocked connection that has registered for an unlock-notify
** callback. ^If two or more such blocked connections have specified the
** same callback function, then instead of invoking the callback function
** multiple times, it is invoked once with the set of void* context pointers
** specified by the blocked connections bundled together into an array.
** This gives the application an opportunity to prioritize any actions 
** related to the set of unblocked database connections.
**
** <b>Deadlock Detection</b>
**
** Assuming that after registering for an unlock-notify callback a 
** database waits for the callback to be issued before taking any further
** action (a reasonable assumption), then using this API may cause the
** application to deadlock. For example, if connection X is waiting for
** connection Y's transaction to be concluded, and similarly connection
** Y is waiting on connection X's transaction, then neither connection
** will proceed and the system may remain deadlocked indefinitely.
**
** To avoid this scenario, the sqlite4_unlock_notify() performs deadlock
** detection. ^If a given call to sqlite4_unlock_notify() would put the
** system in a deadlocked state, then SQLITE_LOCKED is returned and no
** unlock-notify callback is registered. The system is said to be in
** a deadlocked state if connection A has registered for an unlock-notify
** callback on the conclusion of connection B's transaction, and connection
** B has itself registered for an unlock-notify callback when connection
** A's transaction is concluded. ^Indirect deadlock is also detected, so
** the system is also considered to be deadlocked if connection B has
** registered for an unlock-notify callback on the conclusion of connection
** C's transaction, where connection C is waiting on connection A. ^Any
** number of levels of indirection are allowed.
**
** <b>The "DROP TABLE" Exception</b>
**
** When a call to [sqlite4_step()] returns SQLITE_LOCKED, it is almost 
** always appropriate to call sqlite4_unlock_notify(). There is however,
** one exception. When executing a "DROP TABLE" or "DROP INDEX" statement,
** SQLite checks if there are any currently executing SELECT statements
** that belong to the same connection. If there are, SQLITE_LOCKED is
** returned. In this case there is no "blocking connection", so invoking
** sqlite4_unlock_notify() results in the unlock-notify callback being
** invoked immediately. If the application then re-attempts the "DROP TABLE"
** or "DROP INDEX" query, an infinite loop might be the result.
**
** One way around this problem is to check the extended error code returned
** by an sqlite4_step() call. ^(If there is a blocking connection, then the
** extended error code is set to SQLITE_LOCKED_SHAREDCACHE. Otherwise, in
** the special "DROP TABLE/INDEX" case, the extended error code is just 
** SQLITE_LOCKED.)^

**
** If X is non-zero, then the virtual table implementation guarantees
