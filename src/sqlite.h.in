** argument.  ^If the callback function of the 3rd argument to

** sqlite4_exec() is relayed through to the 1st argument of each
** callback invocation.  ^If the callback pointer to sqlite4_exec()
** is NULL, then no callback is ever invoked and result rows are
** ignored.
**
** ^If an error occurs while evaluating the SQL statements passed into
** sqlite4_exec(), then execution of the current statement stops and
** subsequent statements are skipped.  ^If the 5th parameter to sqlite4_exec()
** is not NULL then any error message is written into memory obtained

** To avoid memory leaks, the application should invoke [sqlite4_free()]
** on error message strings returned through the 5th parameter of
** of sqlite4_exec() after the error message string is no longer needed.
** ^If the 5th parameter to sqlite4_exec() is not NULL and no errors
** occur, then sqlite4_exec() sets the pointer in its 5th parameter to
** NULL before returning.
**
** ^If an sqlite4_exec() callback returns non-zero, the sqlite4_exec()
** routine returns SQLITE4_ABORT without invoking the callback again and
** without running any subsequent SQL statements.
**
** ^The 2nd argument to the sqlite4_exec() callback function is the
** number of columns in the result.  ^The 3rd argument to the sqlite4_exec()
** callback is an array of pointers to strings obtained as if from
** [sqlite4_column_text()], one for each column.  ^If an element of a
** result row is NULL then the corresponding string pointer for the
** sqlite4_exec() callback is a NULL pointer.  ^The 4th argument to the
** sqlite4_exec() callback is an array of pointers to strings where each
** entry represents the name of corresponding result column as obtained
** from [sqlite4_column_name()].
**
** ^If the 2nd parameter to sqlite4_exec() is a NULL pointer, a pointer
** to an empty string, or a pointer that contains only whitespace and/or

** CAPIREF: Memory Allocation Routines
**
** An instance of this object defines the interface between SQLite
** and low-level memory allocation routines.
**
** This object is used in only one place in the SQLite interface.
** A pointer to an instance of this object is the argument to
** [sqlite4_env_config()] when the configuration option is
** [SQLITE4_ENVCONFIG_MALLOC] or [SQLITE4_ENVCONFIG_GETMALLOC].  
** By creating an instance of this object
** and passing it to [sqlite4_env_config]([SQLITE4_ENVCONFIG_MALLOC])
** during configuration, an application can specify an alternative
** memory allocation subsystem for SQLite to use for all of its
** dynamic memory needs.
**
** Note that SQLite comes with several [built-in memory allocators]
** that are perfectly adequate for the overwhelming majority of applications
** and that this object is only useful to a tiny minority of applications
** with specialized memory allocation requirements.  This object is
** also used during testing of SQLite in order to specify an alternative
** memory allocator that simulates memory out-of-memory conditions in
** order to verify that SQLite recovers gracefully from such
** conditions.
**
** The xMalloc, xRealloc, and xFree methods must work like the
** malloc(), realloc() and free() functions from the standard C library.
** ^SQLite guarantees that the second argument to
** xRealloc is always a value returned by a prior call to xRoundup.
**
** xSize should return the allocated size of a memory allocation
** previously obtained from xMalloc or xRealloc.  The allocated size
** is always at least as big as the requested size but may be larger.
**
** The xRoundup method returns what would be the allocated size of
** a memory allocation given a particular requested size.  Most memory
** allocators round up memory allocations at least to the next multiple
** of 8.  Some allocators round up to a larger multiple or to a power of 2.
** Every memory allocation request coming in through [sqlite4_malloc()]
** or [sqlite4_realloc()] first calls xRoundup.  If xRoundup returns 0, 
** that causes the corresponding memory allocation to fail.
**
** The xInit method initializes the memory allocator.  (For example,
** it might allocate any require mutexes or initialize internal data
** structures.  The xShutdown method is invoked (indirectly) by
** [sqlite4_shutdown()] and should deallocate any resources acquired
** by xInit.  The pMemEnv pointer is used as the only parameter to
** xInit and xShutdown.
**
** SQLite holds the [SQLITE4_MUTEX_STATIC_MASTER] mutex when it invokes
** the xInit method, so the xInit method need not be threadsafe.  The
** xShutdown method is only called from [sqlite4_shutdown()] so it does
** not need to be threadsafe either.  For all other methods, SQLite
** holds the [SQLITE4_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM] mutex as long as the
** [SQLITE4_CONFIG_MEMSTATUS] configuration option is turned on (which
** it is by default) and so the methods are automatically serialized.
** However, if [SQLITE4_CONFIG_MEMSTATUS] is disabled, then the other
** methods must be threadsafe or else make their own arrangements for
** serialization.
**
** SQLite will never invoke xInit() more than once without an intervening
** call to xShutdown().

**
** ^(The sqlite4_snprintf() routine is similar to "snprintf()" from
** the standard C library.  The result is written into the
** buffer supplied as the first parameter whose size is given by
** the second parameter.)^  The return value from sqltie4_snprintf()
** is the number of bytes actually written into the buffer, not
** counting the zero terminator.  The buffer is always zero-terminated
** as long as it it at least one byte in length.
**
** The sqlite4_snprintf() differs from the standard library snprintf()
** routine in two ways:  (1) sqlite4_snprintf() returns the number of
** bytes actually written, not the number of bytes that would have been
** written if the buffer had been infinitely long.  (2) If the buffer is
** at least one byte long, sqlite4_snprintf() always zero-terminates its
** result.
**
** ^As long as the buffer size is greater than zero, sqlite4_snprintf()
** guarantees that the buffer is always zero-terminated.  ^The second
** parameter "n" is the total size of the buffer, including space for
** the zero terminator.  So the longest string that can be completely
** written will be n-1 characters.
**
** ^The sqlite4_vsnprintf() routine is a varargs version of sqlite4_snprintf().
**
** These routines all implement some additional formatting
** options that are useful for constructing SQL statements.
** All of the usual printf() formatting options apply.  In addition, there
** is are "%q", "%Q", and "%z" options.
**
** ^(The %q option works like %s in that it substitutes a nul-terminated
** string from the argument list.  But %q also doubles every '\'' character.
** %q is designed for use inside a string literal.)^  By doubling each '\''
** character it escapes that character and allows it to be inserted into
** the string.
**
** For example, assume the string variable zText contains text as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zText = "It's a happy day!";
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** One can use this text in an SQL statement as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zSQL = sqlite4_mprintf("INSERT INTO table VALUES('%q')", zText);
**  sqlite4_exec(db, zSQL, 0, 0, 0);
**  sqlite4_free(zSQL);
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** Because the %q format string is used, the '\'' character in zText
** is escaped and the SQL generated is as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It''s a happy day!')
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** This is correct.  Had we used %s instead of %q, the generated SQL
** would have looked like this:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It's a happy day!');
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** This second example is an SQL syntax error.  As a general rule you should
** always use %q instead of %s when inserting text into a string literal.
**
** ^(The %Q option works like %q except it also adds single quotes around
** the outside of the total string.  Additionally, if the parameter in the
** argument list is a NULL pointer, %Q substitutes the text "NULL" (without
** single quotes).)^  So, for example, one could say:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zSQL = sqlite4_mprintf("INSERT INTO table VALUES(%Q)", zText);
**  sqlite4_exec(db, zSQL, 0, 0, 0);
**  sqlite4_free(zSQL);
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** The code above will render a correct SQL statement in the zSQL
** variable even if the zText variable is a NULL pointer.
**
** ^(The "%z" formatting option works like "%s" but with the
** addition that after the string has been read and copied into
** the result, [sqlite4_free()] is called on the input string.)^

** to the callback are zero-terminated strings that contain additional
** details about the action to be authorized.
**
** ^If the action code is [SQLITE4_READ]
** and the callback returns [SQLITE4_IGNORE] then the
** [prepared statement] statement is constructed to substitute
** a NULL value in place of the table column that would have
** been read if [SQLITE4_OK] had been returned.  The [SQLITE4_IGNORE]
** return can be used to deny an untrusted user access to individual
** columns of a table.
** ^If the action code is [SQLITE4_DELETE] and the callback returns
** [SQLITE4_IGNORE] then the [DELETE] operation proceeds but the
** [truncate optimization] is disabled and all rows are deleted individually.
**
** An authorizer is used when [sqlite4_prepare | preparing]
** SQL statements from an untrusted source, to ensure that the SQL statements
** do not try to access data they are not allowed to see, or that they do not
** try to execute malicious statements that damage the database.  For
** example, an application may allow a user to enter arbitrary
** SQL queries for evaluation by a database.  But the application does
** not want the user to be able to make arbitrary changes to the
** database.  An authorizer could then be put in place while the
** user-entered SQL is being [sqlite4_prepare | prepared] that
** disallows everything except [SELECT] statements.
**
** Applications that need to process SQL from untrusted sources
** might also consider lowering resource limits using [sqlite4_limit()]
** and limiting database size using the [max_page_count] [PRAGMA]
** in addition to using an authorizer.
**
** ^(Only a single authorizer can be in place on a database connection
** at a time.  Each call to sqlite4_set_authorizer overrides the
** previous call.)^  ^Disable the authorizer by installing a NULL callback.
** The authorizer is disabled by default.
**
** The authorizer callback must not do anything that will modify
** the database connection that invoked the authorizer callback.
** Note that [sqlite4_prepare()] and [sqlite4_step()] both modify their
** database connections for the meaning of "modify" in this paragraph.
**
** ^When [sqlite4_prepare()] is used to prepare a statement, the
** statement might be re-prepared during [sqlite4_step()] due to a 
** schema change.  Hence, the application should ensure that the
** correct authorizer callback remains in place during the [sqlite4_step()].
**
** ^Note that the authorizer callback is invoked only during
** [sqlite4_prepare()] or its variants.  Authorization is not
** performed during statement evaluation in [sqlite4_step()], unless
** as stated in the previous paragraph, sqlite4_step() invokes

** The database connection must not have been closed.
**
** The second argument, "zSql", is the statement to be compiled, encoded
** as either UTF-8 or UTF-16.  The sqlite4_prepare()
** interface uses UTF-8, and sqlite4_prepare16()
** uses UTF-16.
**
** ^If the nByte argument is less than zero, then zSql is read up to the

** the nByte-th byte, whichever comes first. If the caller knows
** that the supplied string is nul-terminated, then there is a small
** performance advantage to be gained by passing an nByte parameter that
** is equal to the number of bytes in the input string <i>including</i>
** the nul-terminator bytes as this saves SQLite from having to
** make a copy of the input string.

** CAPIREF: Dynamically Typed Value Object

**
** SQLite uses the sqlite4_value object to represent all values
** that can be stored in a database table. SQLite uses dynamic typing
** for the values it stores.  ^Values stored in sqlite4_value objects
** can be integers, floating point values, strings, BLOBs, or NULL.
**
** An sqlite4_value object may be either "protected" or "unprotected".
** Some interfaces require a protected sqlite4_value.  Other interfaces
** will accept either a protected or an unprotected sqlite4_value.
** Every interface that accepts sqlite4_value arguments specifies
** whether or not it requires a protected sqlite4_value.
**
** The terms "protected" and "unprotected" refer to whether or not
** a mutex is held.  An internal mutex is held for a protected
** sqlite4_value object but no mutex is held for an unprotected
** sqlite4_value object.  If SQLite is compiled to be single-threaded
** (with [SQLITE4_THREADSAFE=0] and with [sqlite4_threadsafe()] returning 0)
** or if SQLite is run in one of reduced mutex modes 
** [SQLITE4_CONFIG_SINGLETHREAD] or [SQLITE4_CONFIG_MULTITHREAD]
** then there is no distinction between protected and unprotected
** sqlite4_value objects and they can be used interchangeably.  However,
** for maximum code portability it is recommended that applications
** still make the distinction between protected and unprotected
** sqlite4_value objects even when not strictly required.
**
** ^The sqlite4_value objects that are passed as parameters into the
** implementation of [application-defined SQL functions] are protected.
** ^The sqlite4_value object returned by
** [sqlite4_column_value()] is unprotected.
** Unprotected sqlite4_value objects may only be used with
** [sqlite4_result_value()] and [sqlite4_bind_value()].
** The [sqlite4_value_blob | sqlite4_value_type()] family of
** interfaces require protected sqlite4_value objects.

** <li>  :VVV
** <li>  @VVV
** <li>  $VVV
** </ul>
**
** In the templates above, NNN represents an integer literal,
** and VVV represents an alphanumeric identifier.)^  ^The values of these
** parameters (also called "host parameter names" or "SQL parameters")
** can be set using the sqlite4_bind_*() routines defined here.
**
** ^The first argument to the sqlite4_bind_*() routines is always
** a pointer to the [sqlite4_stmt] object returned from
** [sqlite4_prepare()] or its variants.
**
** ^The second argument is the index of the SQL parameter to be set.
** ^The leftmost SQL parameter has an index of 1.  ^When the same named
** SQL parameter is used more than once, second and subsequent
** occurrences have the same index as the first occurrence.
** ^The index for named parameters can be looked up using the
** [sqlite4_bind_parameter_index()] API if desired.  ^The index
** for "?NNN" parameters is the value of NNN.
** ^The NNN value must be between 1 and the [sqlite4_limit()]
** parameter [SQLITE4_LIMIT_VARIABLE_NUMBER] (default value: 999).
**
** ^The third argument is the value to bind to the parameter.
**
** ^(In those routines that have a fourth argument, its value is the
** number of bytes in the parameter.  To be clear: the value is the
** number of <u>bytes</u> in the value, not the number of characters.)^
** ^If the fourth parameter is negative, the length of the string is
** the number of bytes up to the first zero terminator.
** If a non-negative fourth parameter is provided to sqlite4_bind_text()
** or sqlite4_bind_text16() then that parameter must be the byte offset
** where the NUL terminator would occur assuming the string were NUL
** terminated.  If any NUL characters occur at byte offsets less than 
** the value of the fourth parameter then the resulting string value will
** contain embedded NULs.  The result of expressions involving strings
** with embedded NULs is undefined.
**
** ^The fifth argument to sqlite4_bind_blob(), sqlite4_bind_text(), and
** sqlite4_bind_text16() is a destructor used to dispose of the BLOB or
** string after SQLite has finished with it.  ^The destructor is called
** to dispose of the BLOB or string even if the call to sqlite4_bind_blob(),
** sqlite4_bind_text(), or sqlite4_bind_text16() fails.  
** ^If the fifth argument is
** the special value [SQLITE4_STATIC], then SQLite assumes that the
** information is in static, unmanaged space and does not need to be freed.
** ^If the fifth argument has the value [SQLITE4_TRANSIENT], then
** SQLite makes its own private copy of the data immediately, before
** the sqlite4_bind_*() routine returns.
**
** ^If any of the sqlite4_bind_*() routines are called with a NULL pointer
** for the [prepared statement] or with a prepared statement for which
** [sqlite4_step()] has been called more recently than [sqlite4_reset()],

**
** Note that when type conversions occur, pointers returned by prior
** calls to sqlite4_column_blob(), sqlite4_column_text(), and/or

** <ul>
** <li> The initial content is a BLOB and sqlite4_column_text() or
**      sqlite4_column_text16() is called.  A zero-terminator might
**      need to be added to the string.</li>
** <li> The initial content is UTF-8 text and sqlite4_column_bytes16() or
**      sqlite4_column_text16() is called.  The content must be converted
**      to UTF-16.</li>
** <li> The initial content is UTF-16 text and sqlite4_column_bytes() or
**      sqlite4_column_text() is called.  The content must be converted
**      to UTF-8.</li>
** </ul>
**
** ^Conversions between UTF-16be and UTF-16le are always done in place and do
** not invalidate a prior pointer, though of course the content of the buffer
** that the prior pointer references will have been modified.  Other kinds
** of conversion are done in place when it is possible, but sometimes they
** are not possible and in those cases prior pointers are invalidated.
**
** The safest and easiest to remember policy is to invoke these routines
** in one of the following ways:
**
** <ul>
**  <li>sqlite4_column_text() followed by sqlite4_column_bytes()</li>
**  <li>sqlite4_column_blob() followed by sqlite4_column_bytes()</li>
**  <li>sqlite4_column_text16() followed by sqlite4_column_bytes16()</li>
** </ul>
**
** In other words, you should call sqlite4_column_text(),
** sqlite4_column_blob(), or sqlite4_column_text16() first to force the result
** into the desired format, then invoke sqlite4_column_bytes() or
** sqlite4_column_bytes16() to find the size of the result.  Do not mix calls
** to sqlite4_column_text() or sqlite4_column_blob() with calls to
** sqlite4_column_bytes16(), and do not mix calls to sqlite4_column_text16()
** with calls to sqlite4_column_bytes().
**

**
** ^These functions (collectively known as "function creation routines")
** are used to add SQL functions or aggregates or to redefine the behavior
** of existing SQL functions or aggregates.  The only differences between
** these routines are the text encoding expected for
** the second parameter (the name of the function being created)
** and the presence or absence of a destructor callback for
** the application data pointer.
**
** ^The first parameter is the [database connection] to which the SQL
** function is to be added.  ^If an application uses more than one database
** connection then application-defined SQL functions must be added
** to each database connection separately.
**
** ^The second parameter is the name of the SQL function to be created or
** redefined.  ^The length of the name is limited to 255 bytes in a UTF-8
** representation, exclusive of the zero-terminator.  ^Note that the name
** length limit is in UTF-8 bytes, not characters nor UTF-16 bytes.  
** ^Any attempt to create a function with a longer name
** will result in [SQLITE4_MISUSE] being returned.
**
** ^The third parameter (nArg)
** is the number of arguments that the SQL function or
** aggregate takes. ^If this parameter is -1, then the SQL function or
** aggregate may take any number of arguments between 0 and the limit
** set by [sqlite4_limit]([SQLITE4_LIMIT_FUNCTION_ARG]).  If the third
** parameter is less than -1 or greater than 127 then the behavior is
** undefined.
**
** ^The fourth parameter, eTextRep, specifies what
** [SQLITE4_UTF8 | text encoding] this SQL function prefers for
** its parameters.  Every SQL function implementation must be able to work
** with UTF-8, UTF-16le, or UTF-16be.  But some implementations may be
** more efficient with one encoding than another.  ^An application may
** invoke sqlite4_create_function() or sqlite4_create_function16() multiple
** times with the same function but with different values of eTextRep.
** ^When multiple implementations of the same function are available, SQLite
** will pick the one that involves the least amount of data conversion.
** If there is only a single implementation which does not care what text
** encoding is used, then the fourth argument should be [SQLITE4_ANY].
**
** ^(The fifth parameter is an arbitrary pointer.  The implementation of the
** function can gain access to this pointer using [sqlite4_user_data()].)^
**
** ^The sixth, seventh and eighth parameters, xFunc, xStep and xFinal, are
** pointers to C-language functions that implement the SQL function or
** aggregate. ^A scalar SQL function requires an implementation of the xFunc
** callback only; NULL pointers must be passed as the xStep and xFinal
** parameters. ^An aggregate SQL function requires an implementation of xStep
** and xFinal and NULL pointer must be passed for xFunc. ^To delete an existing
** SQL function or aggregate, pass NULL pointers for all three function
** callbacks.
**
** ^(If the ninth parameter to sqlite4_create_function_v2() is not NULL,
** then it is destructor for the application data pointer. 
** The destructor is invoked when the function is deleted, either by being
** overloaded or when the database connection closes.)^
** ^The destructor is also invoked if the call to
** sqlite4_create_function_v2() fails.
** ^When the destructor callback of the tenth parameter is invoked, it
** is passed a single argument which is a copy of the application data 
** pointer which was the fifth parameter to sqlite4_create_function_v2().
**
** ^It is permitted to register multiple implementations of the same
** functions with the same name but with either differing numbers of
** arguments or differing preferred text encodings.  ^SQLite will use
** the implementation that most closely matches the way in which the
** SQL function is used.  ^A function implementation with a non-negative
** nArg parameter is a better match than a function implementation with
** a negative nArg.  ^A function where the preferred text encoding
** matches the database encoding is a better
** match than a function where the encoding is different.  
** ^A function where the encoding difference is between UTF16le and UTF16be
** is a closer match than a function where the encoding difference is
** between UTF8 and UTF16.
**
** ^Built-in functions may be overloaded by new application-defined functions.
**
** ^An application-defined function is permitted to call other
** SQLite interfaces.  However, such calls must not

** CAPIREF: Mutex Methods Object
**
** An instance of this structure defines the low-level routines
** used to allocate and use mutexes.
**
** Usually, the default mutex implementations provided by SQLite are
** sufficient, however the user has the option of substituting a custom
** implementation for specialized deployments or systems for which SQLite
** does not provide a suitable implementation. In this case, the user
** creates and populates an instance of this structure to pass
** to sqlite4_env_config() along with the [SQLITE4_CONFIG_MUTEX] option.
** Additionally, an instance of this structure can be used as an
** output variable when querying the system for the current mutex
** implementation, using the [SQLITE4_CONFIG_GETMUTEX] option.
**
** ^The xMutexInit method defined by this structure is invoked as
** part of system initialization by the sqlite4_initialize() function.
** ^The xMutexInit routine is called by SQLite exactly once for each
** effective call to [sqlite4_initialize()].
**
** ^The xMutexEnd method defined by this structure is invoked as
** part of system shutdown by the sqlite4_shutdown() function. The
** implementation of this method is expected to release all outstanding
** resources obtained by the mutex methods implementation, especially
** those obtained by the xMutexInit method.  ^The xMutexEnd()
** interface is invoked exactly once for each call to [sqlite4_shutdown()].
**
** ^(The remaining seven methods defined by this structure (xMutexAlloc,
** xMutexFree, xMutexEnter, xMutexTry, xMutexLeave, xMutexHeld and
** xMutexNotheld) implement the following interfaces (respectively):
**
** <ul>
**   <li>  [sqlite4_mutex_alloc()] </li>
**   <li>  [sqlite4_mutex_free()] </li>
**   <li>  [sqlite4_mutex_enter()] </li>
**   <li>  [sqlite4_mutex_try()] </li>
**   <li>  [sqlite4_mutex_leave()] </li>
**   <li>  [sqlite4_mutex_held()] </li>
**   <li>  [sqlite4_mutex_notheld()] </li>
** </ul>)^
**
** The only difference is that the public sqlite4_XXX functions enumerated
** above silently ignore any invocations that pass a NULL pointer instead
** of a valid mutex handle. The implementations of the methods defined
** by this structure are not required to handle this case, the results
** of passing a NULL pointer instead of a valid mutex handle are undefined
** (i.e. it is acceptable to provide an implementation that segfaults if
** it is passed a NULL pointer).
**
** The xMutexInit() method must be threadsafe.  ^It must be harmless to
** invoke xMutexInit() multiple times within the same process and without
** intervening calls to xMutexEnd().  Second and subsequent calls to
** xMutexInit() must be no-ops.
**
** ^xMutexInit() must not use SQLite memory allocation ([sqlite4_malloc()]
** and its associates).  ^Similarly, xMutexAlloc() must not use SQLite memory
** allocation for a static mutex.  ^However xMutexAlloc() may use SQLite
** memory allocation for a fast or recursive mutex.
**
** ^SQLite will invoke the xMutexEnd() method when [sqlite4_shutdown()] is
** called, but only if the prior call to xMutexInit returned SQLITE4_OK.
** If xMutexInit fails in any way, it is expected to clean up after itself
** prior to returning.

** ^This API is only available if the library was compiled with the
** [SQLITE4_ENABLE_UNLOCK_NOTIFY] C-preprocessor symbol defined.
**
** See Also: [Using the SQLite Unlock Notification Feature].
**
** ^Shared-cache locks are released when a database connection concludes
** its current transaction, either by committing it or rolling it back. 
**
** ^When a connection (known as the blocked connection) fails to obtain a
** shared-cache lock and SQLITE4_LOCKED is returned to the caller, the
** identity of the database connection (the blocking connection) that
** has locked the required resource is stored internally. ^After an 
** application receives an SQLITE4_LOCKED error, it may call the
** sqlite4_unlock_notify() method with the blocked connection handle as 
** the first argument to register for a callback that will be invoked
** when the blocking connections current transaction is concluded. ^The
** callback is invoked from within the [sqlite4_step] or [sqlite4_close]
** call that concludes the blocking connections transaction.
**
** ^(If sqlite4_unlock_notify() is called in a multi-threaded application,
** there is a chance that the blocking connection will have already
** concluded its transaction by the time sqlite4_unlock_notify() is invoked.
** If this happens, then the specified callback is invoked immediately,
** from within the call to sqlite4_unlock_notify().)^
**
** ^If the blocked connection is attempting to obtain a write-lock on a
** shared-cache table, and more than one other connection currently holds
** a read-lock on the same table, then SQLite arbitrarily selects one of 
** the other connections to use as the blocking connection.
**
** ^(There may be at most one unlock-notify callback registered by a 
** blocked connection. If sqlite4_unlock_notify() is called when the
** blocked connection already has a registered unlock-notify callback,
** then the new callback replaces the old.)^ ^If sqlite4_unlock_notify() is
** called with a NULL pointer as its second argument, then any existing
** unlock-notify callback is canceled. ^The blocked connections 
** unlock-notify callback may also be canceled by closing the blocked
** connection using [sqlite4_close()].
**
** The unlock-notify callback is not reentrant. If an application invokes
** any sqlite4_xxx API functions from within an unlock-notify callback, a
** crash or deadlock may be the result.
**
** ^Unless deadlock is detected (see below), sqlite4_unlock_notify() always
** returns SQLITE4_OK.
**
** <b>Callback Invocation Details</b>
**
** When an unlock-notify callback is registered, the application provides a 
** single void* pointer that is passed to the callback when it is invoked.
** However, the signature of the callback function allows SQLite to pass
** it an array of void* context pointers. The first argument passed to
** an unlock-notify callback is a pointer to an array of void* pointers,
** and the second is the number of entries in the array.
**
** When a blocking connections transaction is concluded, there may be
** more than one blocked connection that has registered for an unlock-notify
** callback. ^If two or more such blocked connections have specified the
** same callback function, then instead of invoking the callback function
** multiple times, it is invoked once with the set of void* context pointers
** specified by the blocked connections bundled together into an array.
** This gives the application an opportunity to prioritize any actions 
** related to the set of unblocked database connections.
**
** <b>Deadlock Detection</b>
**
** Assuming that after registering for an unlock-notify callback a 
** database waits for the callback to be issued before taking any further
** action (a reasonable assumption), then using this API may cause the
** application to deadlock. For example, if connection X is waiting for
** connection Y's transaction to be concluded, and similarly connection
** Y is waiting on connection X's transaction, then neither connection
** will proceed and the system may remain deadlocked indefinitely.
**
** To avoid this scenario, the sqlite4_unlock_notify() performs deadlock
** detection. ^If a given call to sqlite4_unlock_notify() would put the
** system in a deadlocked state, then SQLITE4_LOCKED is returned and no
** unlock-notify callback is registered. The system is said to be in
** a deadlocked state if connection A has registered for an unlock-notify
** callback on the conclusion of connection B's transaction, and connection
** B has itself registered for an unlock-notify callback when connection
** A's transaction is concluded. ^Indirect deadlock is also detected, so
** the system is also considered to be deadlocked if connection B has
** registered for an unlock-notify callback on the conclusion of connection
** C's transaction, where connection C is waiting on connection A. ^Any
** number of levels of indirection are allowed.
**
** <b>The "DROP TABLE" Exception</b>
**
** When a call to [sqlite4_step()] returns SQLITE4_LOCKED, it is almost 
** always appropriate to call sqlite4_unlock_notify(). There is however,
** one exception. When executing a "DROP TABLE" or "DROP INDEX" statement,
** SQLite checks if there are any currently executing SELECT statements
** that belong to the same connection. If there are, SQLITE4_LOCKED is
** returned. In this case there is no "blocking connection", so invoking
** sqlite4_unlock_notify() results in the unlock-notify callback being
** invoked immediately. If the application then re-attempts the "DROP TABLE"
** or "DROP INDEX" query, an infinite loop might be the result.
**
** One way around this problem is to check the extended error code returned
** by an sqlite4_step() call. ^(If there is a blocking connection, then the
** extended error code is set to SQLITE4_LOCKED_SHAREDCACHE. Otherwise, in
** the special "DROP TABLE/INDEX" case, the extended error code is just 
** SQLITE4_LOCKED.)^

** <dt>SQLITE4_VTAB_CONSTRAINT_SUPPORT
** <dd>Calls of the form
** [sqlite4_vtab_config](db,SQLITE4_VTAB_CONSTRAINT_SUPPORT,X) are supported,
** where X is an integer.  If X is zero, then the [virtual table] whose
** [xCreate] or [xConnect] method invoked [sqlite4_vtab_config()] does not
** support constraints.  In this configuration (which is the default) if
** a call to the [xUpdate] method returns [SQLITE4_CONSTRAINT], then the entire
** statement is rolled back as if [ON CONFLICT | OR ABORT] had been
** specified as part of the users SQL statement, regardless of the actual
** ON CONFLICT mode specified.
**
** If X is non-zero, then the virtual table implementation guarantees
** that if [xUpdate] returns [SQLITE4_CONSTRAINT], it will do so before
** any modifications to internal or persistent data structures have been made.
** If the [ON CONFLICT] mode is ABORT, FAIL, IGNORE or ROLLBACK, SQLite 
** is able to roll back a statement or database transaction, and abandon
** or continue processing the current SQL statement as appropriate. 
** If the ON CONFLICT mode is REPLACE and the [xUpdate] method returns
** [SQLITE4_CONSTRAINT], SQLite handles this as if the ON CONFLICT mode
** had been ABORT.
**
** Virtual table implementations that are required to handle OR REPLACE
** must do so within the [xUpdate] method. If a call to the 
** [sqlite4_vtab_on_conflict()] function indicates that the current ON 
** CONFLICT policy is REPLACE, the virtual table implementation should 
** silently replace the appropriate rows within the xUpdate callback and
** return SQLITE4_OK. Or, if this is not possible, it may return
** SQLITE4_CONSTRAINT, in which case SQLite falls back to OR ABORT 
** constraint handling.
